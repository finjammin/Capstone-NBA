# DATA collection
Part of the reason for me choosing the NBA as my final capstone project was the relatively easy access to alot of data, thanks to websites such as [BasketballReference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/). The first problem I encountered was the vast choice in API's for both basketball-reference and for the NBA website. After testing many different API's I settled on two:
- BasketballReference by [jaebradley](https://github.com/jaebradley/basketball_reference_web_scraper)
- NBA by [swar](https://github.com/swar/nba_api) (with an active slack channel with helpful users)
