# DATA collection
Part of the reason for me choosing the NBA as my final capstone project was the relatively easy access to alot of data, thanks to websites such as https://www.basketball-reference.com/. The first problem I encountered was the vast choice in API's for both basketball-reference and for the NBA website. After testing many different API's I settled on two:
- https://github.com/jaebradley/basketball_reference_web_scraper
- https://github.com/swar/nba_api (particularly useful as they have an active slack chanel, with a passionate group of users, some even offered to collect my data for me providing I sent over the scripts)
